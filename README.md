### Draw a filled-in Rectangle
Click and drag while in Draw mode – a Rectangle will display on the
screen on mouse release. The Rectangle will match the direction and
size of the mouse movement. Rectangle does not need to display while
clicking and dragging – it will suddenly appear on the screen only once
the mouse is released.
### Undo/Redo Draw
### Have at least one design pattern implemented
